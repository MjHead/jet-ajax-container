# Jet Ajax Container for Elementor by Crocoblock

This plugin allows loading the content of any Elementor container asynchronously with AJAX.

Inspired by - https://athirion.fr/elementor-ajax-container-feature-request/

At the moment tested only with most basic content located inside AJAX container, in future requires testing against more exmples of children elements inside containers.

Ajax loading could be enabled for any Elementor container using appropriate control in the Container element settings:
